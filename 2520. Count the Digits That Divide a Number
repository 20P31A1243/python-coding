class Solution:
    def countDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        r,c=0,0
        var=num
        while(num):
            r=num%10
            if(var%r==0):
                c=c+1
            num=num//10
        return c
        Input: num = 1248
Output: 4
Explanation: 1248 is divisible by all of its digits, hence the answer is 4.
1248/1 ,1248/2,1248/4,1248/8 so o/p is 4
